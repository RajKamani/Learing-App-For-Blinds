FUTURE TENSE
Time and tide wait for no man. So, a period of time following the moment of
speaking or writing is called as future tense.
For e.g- She will write a letter.
Simple Future
This tense tells us about an action which has not occurred yet and will occur after
saying or in future
Rule – Will/Shall + Verb (Ist form)
In Future Tense helping verb ‘Shall’ is used with ‘I’ and ‘We’. Helping verb ‘Will’
is used with all others. When you are to make a commitment or warn someone or
emphasize something, use of 'will/shall' is reversed. ‘Will’ is used with ‘I’ & ‘We’
and 'shall' is used with others.
Tense
Past (before
now) Present (now) Future (After
now)
Simple Future Future
Continuous Future Perfect Future Perfect
Continuous
In general speaking there is hardly any difference between 'shall & will' and
normally ‘Will’ is used with all.
Now, let us use this rule in various forms of sentences;
1. Positive / Affirmative Sentences –
Subject + Will/Shall + Verb (Ist form) + Object + (.)
She will write a letter.
2. Negative Sentences-
 Subject + Will/Shall + Not + Verb (Ist form) + Object + (.)
She will not write a letter.
