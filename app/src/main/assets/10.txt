CONSUMER Rights

We participate in the market both as
producers and consumers. As
producers of goods and services we
could be working in any of the sectors
discussed earlier such as agriculture,
industry, or services. Consumers
participate in the market when they
purchase goods and services that they
need. These are the final goods that
people as consumers use.
In the preceding chapters we
discussed the need for rules and
regulations or steps that would
promote development. These could be
for the protection of workers in the
unorganised sector or to protect
people from high interest rates
charged by moneylenders in the
informal sector. Similarly, rules and
regulations are also required for
protecting the environment.
For example, moneylenders in the
informal sector that you read about
in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to
bind the borrower: they could make
the producer sell the produce to them
at a low rate in return for a timely loan;
they could force a small farmer like
Swapna to sell her land to pay back
the loan. Similarly, many people who
work in the unorganised sector have
to work at a low wage and accept
conditions that are not fair and are
also often harmful to their health. To
prevent such exploitation, we
have talked of rules and regulations
for their protection. There are
organisations that have struggled
for long to ensure that these rules are
followed.
THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE

Likewise, rules and regulations are
required for the protection of the
consumers in the marketplace.
Individual consumers often find
themselves in a weak position.
Whenever there is a complaint
regarding a good or service that had
been bought, the seller tries to shift
all the responsibility on to the buyer.
Their position usually is – “If you
didn’t like what you bought, please
go elsewhere”. As if the seller has no
responsibility once a sale is
completed! The consumer movement,
as we shall discuss later, is an effort
to change this situation.
Exploitation in the marketplace
happens in various ways. For
example, sometimes traders indulge
in unfair trade practices such as when
shopkeepers weigh less than what
they should or when traders add
charges that were not mentioned
before, or when adulterated/defective
goods are sold.
Markets do not work in a fair
manner when producers are few and
powerful whereas consumers
purchase in small amounts and are
scattered. This happens especially
when large companies are producing
these goods. These companies with
huge wealth, power and reach can
manipulate the market in various
ways. At times false information is
passed on through the media, and
other sources to attract consumers.
For example, a company for years
sold powder milk for babies all over

THEY PURPOSELY MADE IT

the world as the most scientific
product claiming this to be better
than mother’s milk. It took years of
struggle before the company was
forced to accept that it had been
making false claims. Similarly, a
long battle had to be fought with

court cases to make cigarette-
manufacturing companies accept that

their product could cause cancer.
Hence, there is a need for rules and
regulations to ensure protection for
consumers.

CONSUMER MOVEMENT

quality of goods and services on the
sellers.
In India, the consumer movement
as a ‘social force’ originated with the
necessity of protecting and promoting
the interests of consumers against
unethical and unfair trade practices.
Rampant food shortages, hoarding,
black marketing, adulteration of food
and edible oil gave birth to the
consumer movement in an organised
form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s,
consumer organisations were largely
engaged in writing articles and
holding exhibitions. They formed
consumer groups to look into the
malpractices in ration shops and
overcrowding in the road passenger
transport. More recently, India
witnessed an upsurge in the number
of consumer groups.

The consumer movement arose out
of dissatisfaction of the consumers
as many unfair practices were being
indulged in by the sellers. There was
no legal system available to
consumers to protect them from
exploitation in the marketplace. For
a long time, when a consumer was
not happy with a particular brand
product or shop, he or she generally
avoided buying that brand product,
or would stop purchasing from that
shop. It was presumed that it was
the responsibility of consumers to be
careful while buying a commodity
or service. It took many years for
organisations in India, and around
the world, to create awareness
amongst people. This has also
shifted the responsibility of ensuring

Consumers International
In 1985 United Nations adopted
the UN Guidelines for Consumer
Protection. This was a tool for
nations to adopt measures to
protect consumers and for
consumer advocacy groups to
press their governments to do
so. At the international level, this
has become the foundation for
consumer movement. Today,
Consumers International has
become an umbrella body of 240
organisations from over 100
countries.

Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in
bringing pressure on business firms as well as government
to correct business conduct which may be unfair and against
the interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in
1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the
Consumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA.
You will learn more about COPRA later.

SAFETY IS EVERYONE’S RIGHT
Reji’s Suffering
CONSUMER RIGHTS

Reji’s suffering shows how a
hospital, due to negligence by the
doctors and staff in giving
anaesthesia, crippled a student for
life. While using many goods and
services, we as consumers, have the
right to be protected against the
marketing of goods and delivery of
services that are hazardous to life and
property. Producers need to strictly
follow the required safety rules and
regulations. There are many goods
and services that we purchase that
require special attention to safety. For
example, pressure cookers have a
safety valve which, if it is defective, can
cause a serious accident. The
manufacturers of the safety valve have
to ensure high quality. You also need
public or government action to see
that this quality is maintained.
However, we do find bad quality
products in the market because the
supervision of these rules is weak and
the consumer movement is also not
strong enough.

1. For the following (you can add to the list) products/services discuss what safety
rules should be observed by the producer?
(a) LPG cyclinder (b) cinema theatre (c) circus (d) medicines (e) edible oil
(f) marriage pandal (g) a high-rise building.
2. Find out any case of accident or negligence from people around you, where you think
that the responsibility lay with the producer. Discuss.

Reji Mathew, a healthy boy studying in
Class IX, was admitted in a private clinic in
Kerala for removal of tonsils. An ENT
surgeon performed the tonsillectomy
operation under general anaesthesia. As a
result of improper anaesthesia Reji showed
symptoms of some brain abnormalities
because of which he was crippled for life.
His father filed a complaint in the State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
claiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for
medical negligence and deficiency, in
service. The State Commission, saying that
the evidence was not sufficient dismissed
it. Reji’s father appealed again in the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission located
in New Delhi. The
National Commission
after looking into the
complaint, held the
hospital responsible
for medical negligence
and directed it to pay
the compensation.


80 UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Information about goods and
services
When you buy any commodity, you
will find certain details given on the
packing. These details are about
ingredients used, price, batch
number, date of manufacture, expiry
date and the address of the
manufacturer. When we buy
medicines, on the packets, you might
find ‘directions for proper use’ and
information relating to side effects and
risks associated with usage of that
medicine. When you buy garments,
you will find information on
‘instructions for washing’.
Why is it that rules have been made
so that the manufacturer displays this
information? It is because consumers
have the right to be informed about
the particulars of goods and services
that they purchase. Consumers
can then complain and ask for
compensation or replacement if the
product proves to be defective in any
manner. For example, if we buy a

product and find it defective well
within the expiry period, we can ask
for a replacement. If the expiry period
was not printed, the manufacturer
would blame the shopkeeper and will
not accept the responsibility. If people
sell medicines that have expired
severe action can be taken against
them. Similarly, one can protest and
complain if someone sells a good at
more than the printed price on the
packet. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ —
maximum retail price. In fact
consumers can bargain with the seller
to sell at less than the MRP.
In recent times, the right to
information has been expanded to
cover various services provided by the
Government. In October 2005, the
Government of India enacted a law,
popularly known as RTI (Right to
Information) Act, which ensures its
citizens all the information about the
functions of government departments.
The effect of the RTI Act can be
understood from the following case.

Waiting... Waiting...
Amritha, an engineering
graduate after submitting all
the certificates and attending
the interview for a job in a
government department, did
not receive any news of the
result. The officials also
refused to comply with her
queries. She therefore filed an
application using the RTI Act
saying that it was her right to
know the result in a
reasonable time so that she
could plan her future. She
soon got her call letter for
appointment.

1. When we buy commodities we find that the price charged is sometimes higher or
lower than the Maximum Retail Price printed on the pack. Discuss the possible
reasons. Should consumer groups do something about this?
2. Pick up a few packaged goods that you want to buy and examine the information
given. In what ways are they useful? Is there some information that you think
should be given on those packaged goods but is not? Discuss.
3. People make complaints about the lack of civic amenities such as bad roads or
poor water and health facilities but no one listens. Now the RTI Act gives you the
power to question. Do you agree? Discuss.

Abirami, a student of

Ansari Nagar, joined a two-
year course at a local

coaching institute for
professional courses in
New Delhi. At the time of
joining the course, she
paid the fees Rs 61,020
as lumpsum for the entire
course of two years.
However, she decided to opt out of the
course at the end of one year as she
found that the quality of teaching was
not up to the mark. When she asked
for a refund of the fee for one year, it
was denied to her.
When she filed the case in the District
Consumer Court, the Court directed
the Institute to refund Rs 28,000
saying that she had the right to

choose. The Institute
again appealed in the

State Consumer Com-
mission. The State

Commission upheld the
district court’s direction
and further fined the
institute Rs 25,000 for a
frivolous appeal. It also
directed the institute to
pay Rs 7000 as compensation and
litigation cost.
The State Commission also restrained
all the educational and professional
institutions in the state from charging
fees from students for the entire
duration of the course in advance and
that too at one go. Any violation of this
order may invite penalties and
imprisonment, the commission said.

84 UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The consumer movement in India
has led to the formation of various
organisations locally known as
consumer forums or consumer
protection councils. They guide
consumers on how to file cases in the
consumer court. On many occasions,
they also represent individual
consumers in the consumer courts.
These voluntary organisations also
receive financial support from the
government for creating awareness
among the people.
If you are living in a residential
colony, you might have noticed
name boards of Resident Welfare
Associations. If there is any unfair
trade practice meted out to their
members they take up the case on
their behalf.

Arrange the following in the correct order.
(a) Arita files a case in the District Consumer Court.
(b) She engages a professional person.
(c) She realises that the dealer has given her defective
material.
(d) She starts attending the court proceedings.
(e) She goes and complains to the dealer and the Branch
office, to no effect.
(f) She is asked to produce the bill and warranty before
the court.
(g) She purchases a wall clock from a retail outlet.
(h) Within a few months, the dealer was ordered by the
court to replace her old wall clock with a brand new
one at no extra cost.

Under COPRA, a three-tier quasi-
judicial machinery at the district,

state and national levels was set up
for redressal of consumer disputes.
The district level court deals with the
cases involving claims upto Rs 20
lakhs, the state level courts between
Rs 20 lakhs and Rs 1 crore and the
national level court deals with cases
involving claims exceeding Rs 1 crore.
If a case is dismissed in district level
court, the consumer can also appeal
in state and then in National level
courts.
Thus, the Act has enabled us as
consumers to have the right to
represent in the consumer courts.

of our rights? Look at the posters on
the right and in the previous page.
What do you think?
The enactment of COPRA has led
to the setting up of separate
departments of Consumer Affairs in
central and state governments. The
posters that you have seen are one
example through which government
spread information about legal
process which people can use.
You might also be seeing such
advertisements on television channels.

ISI and Agmark
While buying many commodities, on the
cover, you might have seen a logo with the
letters ISI, Agmark or Hallmark. These
logos and certification help consumers get
assured of quality while purchasing the
goods and services. The organisations that
monitor and issue these certificates allow
producers to use their logos provided they
follow certain quality standards.
Though these organisations develop
quality standards for many products, it is
not compulsory for all the producers to
follow standards. However, for some
products that affect the health and safety
of consumers or of products of mass
consumption like LPG cylinders, food
colours and additives, cement, packaged
drinking water, it is mandatory on the part
of the producers to get certified by these
organisations.

India has been observing 24
December as the National Consumers’
Day. It was on this day that the Indian
Parliament enacted the Consumer
Protection Act in 1986. India is one
of the countries that have exclusive
courts for consumer redressal.
The consumer movement in India
has made some progress in terms of
numbers of organised groups and

their work.
However, the consumer redressal
process is becoming cumbersome,
